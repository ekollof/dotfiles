# My dotfiles

This is done through a bare git repository. The way to set it up is outlined here:

<https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/>

Tools I use (that are most certainly referenced in the dotfiles):

- Terminals: st, urxvt, xterm
- Launchers: dmenu/rofi
- Theme engines:
    - pywal <https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal> : Shell colors/wallpapers
    - oomox <https://github.com/themix-project/oomox> : Icon/gtk theming based on above
- Shells: zsh
- Wallpapers included (don't forget to check out git submodules)

Enjoy!
